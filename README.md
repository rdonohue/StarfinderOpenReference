  Associated User Stories:
    
    - As a user I would like to find spells from Starfinder using various filters to reference
    them and their specifications. High Priority.
    
    - As a developer I would like to store and authenticate user data using web services
    because it will permanently store this data, unlike the temporary storage on the device.
    High Priority.
    
  Bugs and unimplemented features:
    -Back navigation is not fully implemented.
    -While the login screen does verify your credentials, it takes a second click to get into the next fragment.
